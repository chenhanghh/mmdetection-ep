# Mask2Former for Edge Protection Detection

This repository contains an implementation of **Mask2Former** based on the **mmdetection** framework (version 3.3.0). It focuses on detecting missing edge protection in construction environments.

## Overview

The primary objective of this repository is to leverage the **Mask2Former** model, built upon the **mmdetection** framework, for detecting missing edge protection in construction sites. The model is trained to identify regions where safety barriers such as guardrails or other forms of edge protection are missing.
This project uses the **mmdetection** framework (version 3.3.0) for object detection and instance segmentation tasks. It provides a flexible and extensible platform for implementing and training detection models with easy configuration for different detection tasks.
